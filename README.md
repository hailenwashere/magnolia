## Client
The frontend for this project is a Chrome extension. While this extension isn't deployed yet, you can upload it onto Chrome developer tools yourself to test out the project. To do this, go to chrome://extensions and toggle Developer Mode. Then, click Load Unpacked and select the client directory in this project. You should be able to see a new extension named magnolia in your browser. You can pin the extension by clicking the puzzle piece icon in the top right of your Chrome browser, and clicking the pin icon on magnolia.

Clicking on the extension icon for magnolia will popup the extension, which shows insights on fabric composition, care instructions, and red flags in reviews for users to make a more educated decision on the shopping options.

Disclaimer: As of right now, the details page of the extension is populated with static dummy data that simulates what would pop up on a listing of choice.
